# Linking to other posts

You can link to other markdown files using relative paths or absolute paths.

## Relative Link

Here is a link to the [Graphic Designer Post](../graphic-designer.md).

(Note: Since all blog posts are rendered at `/blog/:slug`, a sibling link like `./graphic-designer.md` implies `/blog/graphic-designer.md`).

## Absolute Link

Here is a link to the [UI/UX Guide](/blog/ui-ux-guide).

## Code Tutorial

Check out the [JavaScript Tutorial](../javascript-tutorial.md) (if it was moved to a subfolder).
