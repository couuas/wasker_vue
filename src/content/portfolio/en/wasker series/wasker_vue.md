# 📂 Project Background

> From the [waker_static_template](./wasker_tempalte.md) pure static template to the [wasker_vue_template](./wasker_tempalte.md) Vue 3 driven template, I aimed to build a modern personal site, shifting the focus from simple display to **content-driven** architecture and knowledge base applications.

# 🛠️ Feature List

This is the **ultimate production version** of `wasker`, deeply integrating **3D interactive visuals**, **AI intelligent enhancements**, and a **fully automated multi-platform distribution and routing optimization** system on top of the **Vue 3** architecture.

### 💻 Tech Stack
`Vue 3`, `Vite`, `Three.js`, `3D-Force-Graph`, `Telegram Proxy`, `Cloudflare Workers & Pages`, `Vercel`, `GitHub Actions`

### 🚀 Core Features
*   **✨ 3D Galaxy System**: Built with `Three.js` and `3d-force-graph` to create dynamic data galaxies, supporting node interaction and `GalaxyBottomSheet` responsive panels.
*   **🌍 Multi-Platform Automated Deployment**:
    *   **Single Build Source**: Unified CI/CD execution via `GitHub Actions`.
    *   **Global Tri-Center Distribution**: Automatically synced to **Cloudflare Pages**, **Vercel Edge**, and **GitHub Pages** to eliminate single points of failure.
*   **⚡ Smart Gateway**: Powered by `gateway.js` (Cloudflare Worker). Concurrently probes node latency upon entry and automatically routes to the optimal path.
*   **🤖 Integrated AI Assistant**: Built-in `TheAiAssistant` component providing real-time intelligent guidance and interactive Q&A.
*   **🛡️ Secure Communication Proxy**: Uses `Cloudflare Workers` to proxy backend requests, achieving zero-key exposure for secure message pushing (e.g., Telegram forms).
*   **📄 Media & Automation Enhancements**: Embedded PDF preview (`vue-pdf-embed`) and automated generation of RSS feeds and graph data during build.
