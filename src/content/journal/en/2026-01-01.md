Today marks the beginning of 2026. The morning sun was exceptionally bright, casting long shadows across the quiet street. It feels like the perfect time to reset and focus on the goals ahead.

I spent the morning organizing my workspace and reflecting on the past year. There's so much potential waiting to be untapped.
